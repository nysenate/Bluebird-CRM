*******************************
CiviCRM Error Handler
*******************************

Sometimes CiviCRM can be real tough to debug.  Especially when you are getting
fatal errors, but only by some users, and you can't recreate the problems.
This utility will send you a detailed email when a civicrm fatal error occurs.

Project page:
http://drupal.org/project/civicrm_error

Please report issues in the Drupal issue queue.

*******************************
Installation
*******************************

- Enable the module
- The error handler is automatically changed when the module is active, so no need to
  change the CiviCRM 'global configurations' (and if you disable the module, it is
  automatically changed back, since it uses the hook_civicrm_config).
- Choose an email address to send errors to at
  admin/reports/civicrm_error
